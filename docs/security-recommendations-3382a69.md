## Security Recommendations for SAP Cloud Logging

SAP Cloud Logging publishes a list of recommendations to be considered for security configuration under [SAP BTP Security Recommendations](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-security-recommendations-c8a9bb59fe624f0981efa0eff2497d7d/sap-btp-security-recommendations?seclist-index=BTP-CLS&locale=en-US).

Please verify whether the recommendations are relevant to you and ensure that your Cloud Logging instances are configured accordingly.
