## Next Steps

The landing page provides pointers to a set of pre-built dashboards that help to analyze applications. The dashboards UI also provides the flexibility to create custom dashboards and to configure alerting.

You can now navigate across the dashboards, and set and pin filters to explore what you're interested in. For example, you can focus your search on a specific application, with specific response codes producing unexpectedly high response times.
